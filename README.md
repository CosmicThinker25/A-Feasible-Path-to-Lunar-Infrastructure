# SRIP-R: Modular Regolith Pavers for RASSOR-Class Excavators  
### A Feasible Path to Lunar Infrastructure

![Lunar Infrastructure Concept](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Moon_surface_image.jpg)

## 📘 Abstract
**SRIP-R** (Sintered Regolith Interlocking Pavers – RASSOR) is a modular and scalable system for producing interlocking sintered regolith pavers directly on the lunar surface using existing **RASSOR-class excavators**.  
The concept targets **Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6** within 24 months, demonstrating a robotically managed chain capable of fabricating and deploying durable pavers for **dust-mitigating roads, landing pads, and foundations**.

Each paver requires **0.7 ± 0.1 kWh**, yielding **0.64–1.3 m² of paved surface per Earth day**, providing a feasible, low-risk pathway toward autonomous lunar infrastructure.

## ⚙️ System Overview

- **Base platform:** NASA RASSOR-class excavator (1.93×0.85×0.43 m, 67 kg).
- **Core modules:**
  - Cassette of Heated Molds (CCM)
  - Tamping Hopper (TH)
  - Placement Comb
  - Power and Thermal Control subsystem (resistive + solar)
- **Power draw:** 1.5–2.0 kW (resistive heating + actuators)
- **Output:** 32 pavers/day per unit (0.64 m²/day)

## 🧱 Manufacturing Process

1. Excavation of regolith.  
2. Dosing and compaction into molds.  
3. Resistive or solar sintering to ~1100 °C.  
4. Controlled cooldown to prevent cracking.  
5. Robotic placement in interlocking patterns.
